            The eight "Harry Potter" films are based on a series of seven books, and it's understandable that they couldn't show every   single detail.
            However, some of the details that were left out of the films were really important to the plot of the story, and without them, viewers may not understand what's happening.
            The "Harry Potter" books, by controversial author J.K. Rowling, include details that never made it to the movies.
            Many scenes and characters have been shortened or cut, and there are some moments that were integral to the story that weren't shown on screen at all.
        </p>

        
        <h2 id= "t1">Harry Potter on Privet Drive?</h2>
        <div id='s1'>
            <p class="parag">
            Harry's first visit from Hagrid in "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," during which he learns that he's a wizard, occurs on his birthday, July 31.

            In the film, the two make their way to Diagon Alley the next day to buy school supplies before Hagrid takes Harry to King's Cross station to catch the Hogwarts Express.
            In the book, however, Harry has to go back to the Dursleys for the remainder of the summer. Vernon actually takes him to the station on September 1, which is when the train departs for Hogwarts.

            Based solely on what we see in the film, Harry gets to Hogwarts a month early. 

            Going forward, in almost every movie the opening chapters of the corresponding book are condensed to get Harry to Hogwarts faster, making his long summers on Privet Drive seem brief.

        <div id="s2">
            <p class="parag">
            Arguably one of the most notable missing characters in the films is the mischievous poltergeist Peeves.
            All of Peeve's scenes and big moments  — like attending Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday Party, causing mayhem during Professor Umbridge's time at Hogwarts, and defending the castle during the Battle of Hogwarts — were cut out of the movies.

            According to The Independent, the character was originally supposed to appear in the films and he was played by late actor Rik Mayall. But even though scenes with Peeves were reportedly filmed for "Sorcerer's Stone," the poltergeist was cut from the movie and the series as a whole.

        <h2 id='t3'>Harry’s connection with Voldemort</h2>
        <div id="s3">
            <p class="parag">
                On Harry's first night at Hogwarts, he has a dream that ends up being quite prophetic.
                In the dream, he's wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which gets stuck on his head and tells him to transfer into Slytherin House. He also watches Draco Malfoy morph into Professor Snape.
                This scene was cut from the "Sorcerer's Stone" movie, but without it, it's hard to say why Harry begins to mistrust Quirrell, or where his initial suspicions about Snape and Malfoy's bond come from.
                Both of those things become pretty important in the first movie and beyond, so it was an interesting choice to leave the dream out.
            </p>

        <h2 id="t4">All the challenges in "Sorcerer's Stone"?</h2>
        <div id="s4">
            <p class="parag">
                In the book, we're told that six professors and the headmaster were tasked with setting up enchantments within Hogwarts to protect the Sorcerer's Stone.

                In the film, we only see evidence of five of those.

                Harry, Ron, and Hermione encounter Hagrid's three-headed dog named Fluffy, get stuck in Professor Sprout's Devil's Snare, chase after Professor Flitwick's enchanted keys, and play Professor McGonagall's game of Wizard's Chess. Finally, Harry obtains the stone with the help of the Mirror of Erised, Dumbledore's enchantment.

                What's missing, though, is a battle with Professor Quirrell's second troll (the trio defeats the first one earlier in the movie), and Professor Snape's potion riddle challenge.

                The number of challenges was intentional because seven is considered a magical number both within and outside of the "Harry Potter" franchise, but some of them were still cut from the film.
            </p>

        <h2 id= 't5'>what a Squib is?</h2>
        <div id="s5">
            <p class="parag">
                In "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," readers learn something about the crotchety caretaker Mr. Filch that makes his character more sympathetic.

                The book includes a scene where Harry finds a Kwikspell book, a beginner's magic course for adults, in Filch's office. He has the book because he's a Squib, which is a non-magical person born to at least one magical parent.
                This scene, and the explanation of a Squib as a whole, is completely left out of the movies leaving viewers to piece things together for themselves. 
                Additionally, after the Dementors attack Harry and Dudley in "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Harry's neighbor Arabella Figg shows up and reveals that she is also a Squib and has been watching over Harry on Dumbledore's order.
                Again, Squibs aren't explained in the movies, so it's very unclear to movie viewers why Harry's non-magical neighbor has a relationship with Dumbledore or knowledge of the Wizarding World.
            </p>
            <img class= "img" src="https://pa1.narvii.com/6395/bdbb9f8cbf96dc562e3cc80d449e11da56f09578_hq.gif">

        <h2 id="t6">Who’s Marouders?</h2>
        <div id="s6">
            <p class="parag">
            The big reveal of "Prisoner of Azkaban" centers around the Marauders, but the movie barely addresses them at all.

            The Marauders were Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, Sirius Black, and James Potter who go by Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.

            They were the ones who developed the Marauder's Map that Fred and George give Harry to sneak around the castle. However, in the movie Harry seemingly never figures out that his own father helped create it.

            Also, all of the Marauders (except for Lupin, who was a werewolf) were unregistered Animagi, or wizards who can transform into animals. This knowledge helps readers understand how Sirius escaped from Azkaban and how Pettigrew had been living as the Weasley family's pet rat, but movie viewers are left in the dark.
            </p>

        <div id="s7">
            <p class="parag">
            The house-elves play a huge part in the "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" book — from Hermione starting the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare (S.P.E.W.) to Harry's reunion with Dobby — but the elves are mostly removed from the film.
            In fact, throughout the series, Dobby and Kreacher are the only house-elves with prominent roles in the films, but in the books, Winky is also important to the storyline in "Goblet of Fire" and "Order of the Phoenix."
            Plus there are at least a hundred elves who live and work at Hogwarts.
            </p>

        <h2 id="t8">Harry’s visits to Hogsmeade?</h2>
        <div id="s8">
            <p class="parag">
            After trying and failing to get Vernon Dursley to sign his Hogsmeade permission slip at the beginning of "Prisoner of Azkaban," Harry is forced to stay at school while everyone else enjoys the nearby wizard village.

            The book includes a scene near the end where Harry receives a signed Hogsmeade permission slip from Sirius, who he recently discovered is his godfather and legal guardian.
                
            However, that scene is left out of the movie, which creates some confusion in later films when he's suddenly able to visit the village.
            The house-elves play a huge part in the "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" book — from Hermione starting the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare (S.P.E.W.) to Harry's reunion with Dobby — but the elves are mostly removed from the film.

        <h2 id='t9'>Who’s Pigwidgeon?</h2>
        <div id="s9">
            <p class="parag">
            In the "Goblet of Fire" book, after Ron's pet rat, Scabbers, reveals himself to be Peter Pettigrew in disguise, Sirius sends him a miniature scops owl named Pigwidgeon to keep as a pet at Hogwarts.

            Throughout the fourth book, Harry uses Pig to stay in touch with Sirus, who's in hiding after his escape from Azkaban. 

            However, this plotline is never introduced in the films. The owl can be seen posing with actor Rupert Grint, as Ron, in a promotional still for the fourth movie, but it's unclear why the character never appeared on screen. 

            Later, in the sixth film, what seems to be the same African white-faced owl from the "Goblet of Fire" press photo can be seen in the background of one of the scenes in the Burrow.

        <h2 id="t10">Rita Skeeter is an Animagus?</h2>
        <div id="s10">
            <p class="parag">
            Daily Prophet journalist Rita Skeeter plays a big part in the "Goblet of Fire" book and movie, but the character's final plot point from that storyline was left out of the film. 

            At the end of the fourth book, Hermione figures out that Rita is an unregistered Anigamus who can transform into a beetle — which is how she was getting all of her dramatic, and largely nonfactual, scoops. The young witch then uses this information to blackmail the journalist into staying quiet for a whole year so she can't spread anymore gossip about Harry.

            Hermione further flexes her power over Rita in the fifth book to get her to do an interview with Harry for The Quibbler, Xenophilius Lovegood's alternative newspaper, in order to publish the truth about Voldemort's return.

            None of this is fully explained in the fourth or fifth movies, and in fact, viewers never even find out that Rita is an Animagus.

        <h2 id="t11">Weasleys' magical joke shop</h2>
        <div id="s11">
            <p class="parag"> 
            The Weasleys are not a wealthy family, and we're reminded of this numerous times throughout the series.

            That makes it difficult to imagine how Fred and George easily accomplish their dream of dropping out of school and opening a joke shop.

            When the twins start selling their products in "Order of the Phoenix" and open up the Weasley's Wizard Wheezes shop in "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" no one questions how they paid for it all.

            But readers of the books will know that Harry gave them the 1,000 galleons he earned from winning the Triwizard Tournament.

        <h2 id="t12">Neville's parents</h2>
        <div id="s12">
            <p class="parag">
            Alice and Frank Longbottom appear in a photo in "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix." Warner Bros.
            Neville Longbottom plays an increasingly significant role throughout the book and film series, but his backstory, specifically what happened to his parents, was largely left out of the movies.

            Alice and Frank Longbottom only appear in the films in a photograph that Sirius shares with Harry in "Order of the Phoenix."

            However, in the fifth book, Harry, Ron, and Hermione accidentally meet Neville's parents in their hospital room at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. After they were attacked, captured, and tortured during the First Wizarding War, they both experienced severe mental-health complications that kept them from reentering society or raising their son. 

            All of this serves as a key motivation for including Neville in the final fight against Voldemort and provides readers with a more in-depth look at the character, but the scene wasn't included in the fifth movie.
            </p>
            <img class= "img" src="https://i.imgur.com/7o5G6mt.gif">

        <h2 id="t13">Percy Weasley and his family?</h2>
        <div id="s13" >
            <p class="parag">
            We know that Percy is a strict rule follower given his behavior as a Hogwarts prefect and Head Boy. But after leaving Hogwarts, he goes to work for Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, which drives a wedge between the Weasleys and their son.

            Fudge refuses to believe that Voldemort returned at the end of "Goblet of Fire," and he maintains his stance throughout much of "Order of the Phoenix" despite mounting evidence to the contrary. The Ministry of Magic even works with the Daily Prophet newspaper to publish stories discrediting Harry and Dumbledore's accounts of what happened.

            Percy is loyal to Fudge to a fault, and he even suggests at one point that his family should break ties with Harry, who is like a son to the Weasleys.

            All of this causes him to become estranged from his family, which isn't explained in the films, so his apparent disappearance seems more mysterious.

            The rift also makes for an emotional reunion — that goes unseen in the films — when Percy comes to his senses and returns to fight alongside his family at the final Battle of Hogwarts. 
            </p>

        <h2 id="t14">the Wizarding World and the Muggle World</h2>
        <div id="s14">
            <p class="parag">
                The first book hints that there's some spillover from the Wizarding World to the Muggle (non-magical) World since Vernon Dursley sees people dressed in elaborate robes and overhears people on the street referencing the "Potters" and "Muggles."

                Even Sirius makes the Muggle news in "Prisoner of Azkaban" when he breaks out of the high-security wizard prison.

                The "Half-Blood Prince" movie also leaves out an important scene where the Minister for Magic actually visits the British Prime Ministry to warn him about Voldemort's rising power.

                This connection isn't really mentioned in the movies, except for a handful of scenes that show Death Eaters destroying London.

        <div id="s15">
            <p class="parag">
            After learning that Voldemort has split his soul into seven Horcruxes, Harry and Dumbledore leave Hogwarts for a cave where Dumbledore thinks one of them may be hidden.

            In the cave, we see zombie-like creatures in the water that try to pull Harry under. While watching "Half-Blood Prince," it's obvious that they're probably there to protect the Horcrux, but that's all we know.

            The book, however, describes them in more detail, which makes them way scarier than the movie shows. They're called Inferi, and they're reanimated dead bodies produced by dark magic that Voldemort uses to create an army.

            The concept is terrifying and probably a little difficult to explain in a family film.

        <h2 id="t16">Bill Weasley and his scars</h2>
        <div id="s16">
            <p class="parag">
            At the end of the "Half-Blood Prince" book, there's a battle at Hogwarts after Dumbledore's death.

            Members of the Order of the Phoenix, including Bill Weasley, show up to fight the Death Eaters, and during the fight, Bill gets attacked by the werewolf Fenrir Greyback.

            Bill gets away with just a scar and some side effects since Greyback hadn't fully transitioned before attacking him.

            This battle doesn't exist in the movie — and Bill was removed from the "Goblet of Fire," "Order of the Phoenix," and "Half-Blood Prince" films  — so in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1" the character is both introduced to Harry for the first time and has to explain that he fought a werewolf named Greyback.

            Kreacher is the Black family's house-elf, who Sirius leaves to Harry in his will, along with his family home at 12 Grimmauld Place.

            This explains why Kreacher, who's typically antagonistic toward Harry and his friends, suddenly has to follow his orders in "Deathly Hallows." However, in the films, they don't mention the will, so it just seems like the house-elf had a change of heart.

             <p class="parag">
            In "Order of the Phoenix," Sirius gives Harry a two-way mirror, but Harry forgets about the gift throughout the fifth book, so they never really use it to communicate.

            However, this becomes really important in "Deathly Hallows" when Aberforth Dumbledore, who acquired the other part of the mirror, uses it to keep an eye on Harry and helps the trio escape Malfoy Manor.
                
            The movies never explain that Sirius gave Harry the mirror, and viewers don't even see it until Harry packs a broken shard of it for their journey in "Deathly Hallows - Part 1." The significance of the magical object is not explained until later in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2."

            Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore and Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter. Warner Bros.
            A large portion of the "Deathly Hallows" book focuses on Dumbledore's history told through stories as well as Rita Skeeter's scandalous tell-all.
                
            The backstory includes more about his family, his relationship with the evil wizard Grindelwald, and his dabbling in the Dark Arts. Although these weren't his proudest moments, and they didn't match with Harry's perception of Dumbledore, they're all things that made him one of the most powerful wizards in the world. 
                
            Most of this backstory is removed from the movies, making the character of Dumbledore even more elusive.
