<h2 id="t18">The magical two-way mirror</h2>
<div id="s18">
     <p class="parag">
    In "Order of the Phoenix," Sirius gives Harry a two-way mirror, but Harry forgets about the gift throughout the fifth book, so they never really use it to communicate.

    However, this becomes really important in "Deathly Hallows" when Aberforth Dumbledore, who acquired the other part of the mirror, uses it to keep an eye on Harry and helps the trio escape Malfoy Manor.
        
    The movies never explain that Sirius gave Harry the mirror, and viewers don't even see it until Harry packs a broken shard of it for their journey in "Deathly Hallows - Part 1." The significance of the magical object is not explained until later in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2."

<h2 id="t19">Dumbledore's backstory</h2>
<div id="s19">
     <p class="parag">
    Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore and Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter. Warner Bros.
    A large portion of the "Deathly Hallows" book focuses on Dumbledore's history told through stories as well as Rita Skeeter's scandalous tell-all.
        
    The backstory includes more about his family, his relationship with the evil wizard Grindelwald, and his dabbling in the Dark Arts. Although these weren't his proudest moments, and they didn't match with Harry's perception of Dumbledore, they're all things that made him one of the most powerful wizards in the world. 
        
    Most of this backstory is removed from the movies, making the character of Dumbledore even more elusive.
