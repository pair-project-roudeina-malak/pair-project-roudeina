<h2 id="t13">Percy Weasley and his family?</h2>
<div id="s13" >
    <p class="parag">
    We know that Percy is a strict rule follower given his behavior as a Hogwarts prefect and Head Boy. But after leaving Hogwarts, he goes to work for Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, which drives a wedge between the Weasleys and their son.

    Fudge refuses to believe that Voldemort returned at the end of "Goblet of Fire," and he maintains his stance throughout much of "Order of the Phoenix" despite mounting evidence to the contrary. The Ministry of Magic even works with the Daily Prophet newspaper to publish stories discrediting Harry and Dumbledore's accounts of what happened.

    Percy is loyal to Fudge to a fault, and he even suggests at one point that his family should break ties with Harry, who is like a son to the Weasleys.

    All of this causes him to become estranged from his family, which isn't explained in the films, so his apparent disappearance seems more mysterious.

    The rift also makes for an emotional reunion — that goes unseen in the films — when Percy comes to his senses and returns to fight alongside his family at the final Battle of Hogwarts.

<h2 id="t14">the Wizarding World and the Muggle World</h2>
<div id="s14">
    <p class="parag">
        The first book hints that there's some spillover from the Wizarding World to the Muggle (non-magical) World since Vernon Dursley sees people dressed in elaborate robes and overhears people on the street referencing the "Potters" and "Muggles."

        Even Sirius makes the Muggle news in "Prisoner of Azkaban" when he breaks out of the high-security wizard prison.

        The "Half-Blood Prince" movie also leaves out an important scene where the Minister for Magic actually visits the British Prime Ministry to warn him about Voldemort's rising power.

        This connection isn't really mentioned in the movies, except for a handful of scenes that show Death Eaters destroying London.

<h2 id="t15">Voldemort's army</h2>
<div id="s15">
    <p class="parag">
    After learning that Voldemort has split his soul into seven Horcruxes, Harry and Dumbledore leave Hogwarts for a cave where Dumbledore thinks one of them may be hidden.

    In the cave, we see zombie-like creatures in the water that try to pull Harry under. While watching "Half-Blood Prince," it's obvious that they're probably there to protect the Horcrux, but that's all we know.

    The book, however, describes them in more detail, which makes them way scarier than the movie shows. They're called Inferi, and they're reanimated dead bodies produced by dark magic that Voldemort uses to create an army.

    The concept is terrifying and probably a little difficult to explain in a family film.

<h2 id="t16">Bill Weasley and his scars</h2>
<div id="s16">
    <p class="parag">
    At the end of the "Half-Blood Prince" book, there's a battle at Hogwarts after Dumbledore's death.

    Members of the Order of the Phoenix, including Bill Weasley, show up to fight the Death Eaters, and during the fight, Bill gets attacked by the werewolf Fenrir Greyback.

    Bill gets away with just a scar and some side effects since Greyback hadn't fully transitioned before attacking him.

    This battle doesn't exist in the movie — and Bill was removed from the "Goblet of Fire," "Order of the Phoenix," and "Half-Blood Prince" films  — so in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1" the character is both introduced to Harry for the first time and has to explain that he fought a werewolf named Greyback.

<h2 id="t17">Sirius Black's will</h2>
<div id="s17">
    <p class="parag">
    Kreacher is the Black family's house-elf, who Sirius leaves to Harry in his will, along with his family home at 12 Grimmauld Place.

    This explains why Kreacher, who's typically antagonistic toward Harry and his friends, suddenly has to follow his orders in "Deathly Hallows." However, in the films, they don't mention the will, so it just seems like the house-elf had a change of heart.
