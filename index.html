    <p>           
        The eight "Harry Potter" films are based on a series of seven books, and it's understandable that they couldn't show every   single detail.
        However, some of the details that were left out of the films were really important to the plot of the story, and without them, viewers may not understand what's happening.
        The "Harry Potter" books, by controversial author J.K. Rowling, include details that never made it to the movies.
        Many scenes and characters have been shortened or cut, and there are some moments that were integral to the story that weren't shown on screen at all
