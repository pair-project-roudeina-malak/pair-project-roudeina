<h2 id= 't5'>what a Squib is?</h2>
<div id="s5">
    <p class="parag">
        In "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," readers learn something about the crotchety caretaker Mr. Filch that makes his character more sympathetic.

        The book includes a scene where Harry finds a Kwikspell book, a beginner's magic course for adults, in Filch's office. He has the book because he's a Squib, which is a non-magical person born to at least one magical parent.
        This scene, and the explanation of a Squib as a whole, is completely left out of the movies leaving viewers to piece things together for themselves. 
        Additionally, after the Dementors attack Harry and Dudley in "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Harry's neighbor Arabella Figg shows up and reveals that she is also a Squib and has been watching over Harry on Dumbledore's order.
        Again, Squibs aren't explained in the movies, so it's very unclear to movie viewers why Harry's non-magical neighbor has a relationship with Dumbledore or knowledge of the Wizarding World.

<h2 id="t6">Who’s Marouders?</h2>
<div id="s6">
    <p class="parag">
    The big reveal of "Prisoner of Azkaban" centers around the Marauders, but the movie barely addresses them at all.

    The Marauders were Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, Sirius Black, and James Potter who go by Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.

    They were the ones who developed the Marauder's Map that Fred and George give Harry to sneak around the castle. However, in the movie Harry seemingly never figures out that his own father helped create it.

    Also, all of the Marauders (except for Lupin, who was a werewolf) were unregistered Animagi, or wizards who can transform into animals. This knowledge helps readers understand how Sirius escaped from Azkaban and how Pettigrew had been living as the Weasley family's pet rat, but movie viewers are left in the dark.

<h2 id="t7">Where is the house-elves?</h2>
<div id="s7">
    <p class="parag">
    The house-elves play a huge part in the "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" book — from Hermione starting the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare (S.P.E.W.) to Harry's reunion with Dobby — but the elves are mostly removed from the film.
    In fact, throughout the series, Dobby and Kreacher are the only house-elves with prominent roles in the films, but in the books, Winky is also important to the storyline in "Goblet of Fire" and "Order of the Phoenix."
    Plus there are at least a hundred elves who live and work at Hogwarts.

<h2 id="t8">Harry’s visits to Hogsmeade?</h2>
<div id="s8">
    <p class="parag">
    After trying and failing to get Vernon Dursley to sign his Hogsmeade permission slip at the beginning of "Prisoner of Azkaban," Harry is forced to stay at school while everyone else enjoys the nearby wizard village.

    The book includes a scene near the end where Harry receives a signed Hogsmeade permission slip from Sirius, who he recently discovered is his godfather and legal guardian.
        
    However, that scene is left out of the movie, which creates some confusion in later films when he's suddenly able to visit the village.
