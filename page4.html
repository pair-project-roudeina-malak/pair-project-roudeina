<h2 id='t9'>Who’s Pigwidgeon?</h2>
        <div id="s9">
            <p class="parag">
            In the "Goblet of Fire" book, after Ron's pet rat, Scabbers, reveals himself to be Peter Pettigrew in disguise, Sirius sends him a miniature scops owl named Pigwidgeon to keep as a pet at Hogwarts.

            Throughout the fourth book, Harry uses Pig to stay in touch with Sirus, who's in hiding after his escape from Azkaban. 

            However, this plotline is never introduced in the films. The owl can be seen posing with actor Rupert Grint, as Ron, in a promotional still for the fourth movie, but it's unclear why the character never appeared on screen. 

            Later, in the sixth film, what seems to be the same African white-faced owl from the "Goblet of Fire" press photo can be seen in the background of one of the scenes in the Burrow.

        <h2 id="t10">Rita Skeeter is an Animagus?</h2>
        <div id="s10">
            <p class="parag">
            Daily Prophet journalist Rita Skeeter plays a big part in the "Goblet of Fire" book and movie, but the character's final plot point from that storyline was left out of the film. 

            At the end of the fourth book, Hermione figures out that Rita is an unregistered Anigamus who can transform into a beetle — which is how she was getting all of her dramatic, and largely nonfactual, scoops. The young witch then uses this information to blackmail the journalist into staying quiet for a whole year so she can't spread anymore gossip about Harry.

            Hermione further flexes her power over Rita in the fifth book to get her to do an interview with Harry for The Quibbler, Xenophilius Lovegood's alternative newspaper, in order to publish the truth about Voldemort's return.

            None of this is fully explained in the fourth or fifth movies, and in fact, viewers never even find out that Rita is an Animagus.

        <h2 id="t11">Weasleys' magical joke shop</h2>
        <div id="s11">
            <p class="parag"> 
            The Weasleys are not a wealthy family, and we're reminded of this numerous times throughout the series.

            That makes it difficult to imagine how Fred and George easily accomplish their dream of dropping out of school and opening a joke shop.

            When the twins start selling their products in "Order of the Phoenix" and open up the Weasley's Wizard Wheezes shop in "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" no one questions how they paid for it all.

            But readers of the books will know that Harry gave them the 1,000 galleons he earned from winning the Triwizard Tournament.
