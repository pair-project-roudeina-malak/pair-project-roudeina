<h2 id= "t1">Harry Potter on Privet Drive?</h2>
        <div id='s1'>
            <p class="parag">
            Harry's first visit from Hagrid in "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," during which he learns that he's a wizard, occurs on his birthday, July 31.

            In the film, the two make their way to Diagon Alley the next day to buy school supplies before Hagrid takes Harry to King's Cross station to catch the Hogwarts Express.
            In the book, however, Harry has to go back to the Dursleys for the remainder of the summer. Vernon actually takes him to the station on September 1, which is when the train departs for Hogwarts.

            Based solely on what we see in the film, Harry gets to Hogwarts a month early. 

            Going forward, in almost every movie the opening chapters of the corresponding book are condensed to get Harry to Hogwarts faster, making his long summers on Privet Drive seem brief.

            Arguably one of the most notable missing characters in the films is the mischievous poltergeist Peeves.
            All of Peeve's scenes and big moments  — like attending Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday Party, causing mayhem during Professor Umbridge's time at Hogwarts, and defending the castle during the Battle of Hogwarts — were cut out of the movies.

            According to The Independent, the character was originally supposed to appear in the films and he was played by late actor Rik Mayall. But even though scenes with Peeves were reportedly filmed for "Sorcerer's Stone," the poltergeist was cut from the movie and the series as a whole.

        <h2 id='t3'>Harry’s connection with Voldemort</h2>
        <div id="s3">
            <p class="parag">
                On Harry's first night at Hogwarts, he has a dream that ends up being quite prophetic.
                In the dream, he's wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which gets stuck on his head and tells him to transfer into Slytherin House. He also watches Draco Malfoy morph into Professor Snape.
                This scene was cut from the "Sorcerer's Stone" movie, but without it, it's hard to say why Harry begins to mistrust Quirrell, or where his initial suspicions about Snape and Malfoy's bond come from.
                Both of those things become pretty important in the first movie and beyond, so it was an interesting choice to leave the dream out.

        <h2 id="t4">All the challenges in "Sorcerer's Stone"?</h2>
        <div id="s4">
            <p class="parag">
                In the book, we're told that six professors and the headmaster were tasked with setting up enchantments within Hogwarts to protect the Sorcerer's Stone.

                In the film, we only see evidence of five of those.

                Harry, Ron, and Hermione encounter Hagrid's three-headed dog named Fluffy, get stuck in Professor Sprout's Devil's Snare, chase after Professor Flitwick's enchanted keys, and play Professor McGonagall's game of Wizard's Chess. Finally, Harry obtains the stone with the help of the Mirror of Erised, Dumbledore's enchantment.

                What's missing, though, is a battle with Professor Quirrell's second troll (the trio defeats the first one earlier in the movie), and Professor Snape's potion riddle challenge.

                The number of challenges was intentional because seven is considered a magical number both within and outside of the "Harry Potter" franchise, but some of them were still cut from the film.
